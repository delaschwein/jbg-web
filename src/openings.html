<h2>Positions Available in my Group</h2>

<p>Boulder is a wonderful place to live and to do research.  It's
consistently ranked <a
href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/newsroom/best-of-boulder-community-honors">one
of the best places</a> to study, live, and to raise a family.  It's
home to many <a
href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/08/14/boulder-colo-most-popular-city-for-tech-startups-study-says/">high
tech startups</a>, and one of the best places for studying natural
language processing; it's also home to Jim Martin and Martha Palmer,
giants in NLP.</p>

<h3>Postdocs</h3>

<p>No current openings.</p>

<h3>Graduate Students</h3>

<p>I have openings for one to two fully funded graduate students one of
the following areas for Fall 2016 (application
deadline <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/how-apply">December
15 2014</a>, December 31 for documents):</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Computational Social Science</b>: This research will use
  probabilistic tools such
  as <a href="~~PATHPREFIX~~docs/mlj_2013_itm.pdf">interactive</a> and
  <a href="~~PATHPREFIX~~docs/2013_shlda.pdf">supervised topic
  models</a> to analyze large datasets and leverage experts
  annotations and insights.  This is a collaboration with the
  University of Maryland and Brigham Young University.
  <li> <b>Incremental Text Processing</b>: This research creates
  models of text processing that can use syntactic and semantic tools
  to understand how
  humans <a href="~~PATHPREFIX~~docs/2014_emnlp_qb_rnn.pdf">answer
  questions</a>
  and <a href="~~PATHPREFIX~~docs/2014_emnlp_simtrans.pdf">translate
  text</a>.  We're using both Bayesian and deep learning methods to
  address these questions and apply them in real-world settings.  This
  is a collaboration with the University of Maryland and Princeton
  University.
</ul>

<h3>Undergraduates</h3>

<p>I'm interested in hosting undergraduates from leading institutions,
but only if an introduction is made through <b>a faculty member that I
know</b> and who can vouch for the student.  I'm also only able to
fund US citizens.</p>

<h3>High School Students</h3>

<p>I'm only interested in working with high school students in the
Boulder / Denver area.  They must already know how to program in
Python and be extremely motivated.</p>
