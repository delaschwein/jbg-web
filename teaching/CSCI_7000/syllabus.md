Description and Outcomes
========================

Computers have made it possible, even easy, to collect vast amounts of
data from a wide variety of sources. It is not always clear, however,
how to use those data and how to extract useful information from
data. The goal of this course is to review the principles of allowing
machines to make sense of text data in a mathematically and
linguistically rigorous way.

By the end of this course, you'll be able to understand current
research in NLP, compare different approaches for solving problems in
NLP, and how to evaluate the results.

Approach
========================

Each week, we'll discuss a state-of-the art approach in natural
language processing. Each class section will have three parts:
* Overview / Context
* Mathematical Foundation
* Detailed Example

For the first two classes, I'll do all three components.  Later
classes will have students doing the last two segments (with input
from me and the course assistant).

Finally, it is required that you have regular access to a computer and
an Internet connection throughout this course. A laptop is
preferable. If you have a laptop, it would be useful to bring the
laptop to class, especially for the in-class exercises.

Topic Objectives (Check course webpage for dates)
-------------------

* Deep Learning for Text
* Bayesian Generative Models for Text
* Frameworks for Learning from Text
* Evaluation

Required Background
---

I assume that you know basic machine learning techniques (logistic
regression) and NLP algorithms (Viterbi).  CSCI 5832 or CSCI 5622 will
provide this background.  You'll also need to be able to read recent
research papers in NLP and machine learning (we'll obviously work
through the trickier bits in class).

Grading
-

Components of the final grade are as follows:

Percentage
* Mathematical Treatment 25%
* Detailed Demonstration 25%
* Final Project 30%
* Participation 20%

Assignments
=

Each student will need to contribute to a class by producing a
mathematical description and a detailed demonstration of the class's
topic (I will likely have a suggestion).
* You do not need to choose the same class for the mathematical description and detailed description
* Because there are more students than slots, some slots will have double the students.  I expect twice as good treatments those weeks.
* If you're presenting on Monday of week N, you'll need to
    * present a five minute outline on Monday week N-2
    * post a revised outline on Wednesday of week N-2 for general feedback
    * give a practice presentation before Wednesday of week N-1 to the course assistant
    * submit materials to professor (via Github) 

Materials must be in PDF form that are easily editable in either LaTeX
or a high-level programming language that generates the PDF.

You'll also pursue a course project with up to two other classmates by
the end of the course.  You'll need to present a proposal before
Spring Break, and more information will be provided at that time.

Class Participation
-

Each class is critical to your learning experience, and I expect you
to come to class prepared (having read all assigned readings, viewed
the lecture, ready to engage). I also expect active participation, not
passive reception of the material. Your energy in contributing to
class discussions and hands-on exercises will make this class an
enjoyable experience for all of us.

We will also be using the online learning platform Piazza.  You can
get credit for participation by answering and asking useful questions
on that platform.  Ideally you should be participating both online and
in class, however.

Academic Integrity
-

All students of the University of Colorado at Boulder are responsible
for knowing and adhering to the academic integrity policy of this
institution. Violations of this policy may include: cheating,
plagiarism, aid of academic dishonesty, fabrication, lying, bribery,
and threatening behavior.  All incidents of academic misconduct shall
be reported to the Honor Code Council (honor@colorado.edu;
303-735-2273). Students who are found to be in violation of the
academic integrity policy will be subject to both academic sanctions
from the faculty member and non-academic sanctions (including but not
limited to university probation, suspension, or expulsion).

Other information on the Honor Code can be found at
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html and at
http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/.

Course Policies
-

If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability, please
submit to your professor a letter from Disability Services in a timely
manner (for exam accommodations provide your letter at least one week
prior to the exam) so that your needs can be addressed. Disability
Services determines accommodations based on documented
disabilities. Contact Disability Services at 303-492-8671 or by e-mail
at dsinfo@colorado.edu. If you have a temporary medical condition or
injury, see Temporary Injuries guidelines under the Quick Links at the
Disability Services website and discuss your needs with your
professor. Please inform the professor of any accommodations needed
relative to disabilities at the start of the semester.

Campus policy regarding religious observances requires that faculty
make every effort to deal reasonably and fairly with all students who,
because of religious obligations, have conflicts with scheduled exams,
assignments or required attendance. In this class, inform the
professors of conflicts at the start of the semester.  See full
details at http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html

Students and faculty each have responsibility for maintaining an
appropriate learning environment. Those who fail to adhere to such
behavioral standards may be subject to discipline. Professional
courtesy and sensitivity are especially important with respect to
individuals and topics dealing with differences of race, culture,
religion, politics, sexual orientation, gender, gender variance, and
nationalities.  Class rosters are provided to the instructor with the
student's legal name. I will gladly honor your request to address you
by an alternate name or gender pronoun. Please advise me of this
preference early in the semester so that I may make appropriate
changes to my records.  See policies at
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html and at
http://www.colorado.edu/studentaffairs/judicialaffairs/code.html#student_code.
