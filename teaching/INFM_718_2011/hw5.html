  <h2>Assignment 5: Cloud-based Bacon Services </h2>
  
  <p><b>Due:</b> Thursday 4/14 (11:59pm)</p>

  <h3>Background</h3>

  <p>Some folks used to play a game called
  "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon">Six Degrees
  of Kevin Bacon</a>."  The idea is that you were given a name of a person, and
  you had to link that person up to Kevin Bacon based on films they both
  appeared in.  For example, let's say you were challenged to link Kiefer
  Sutherland.  One possible answer is: <b>Kiefer Sutherland was in <i>A Time To
  Kill</i> with his dad, Donald Sutherland, who was in <i>JFK</i> with Kevin
  Bacon</b>.  But this isn't the best answer, as Kevin Bacon was
  in <i>Flatliners</i> with Kevin Bacon.</p>

  <p>Algorithm-wise, this is called bidirectional search.  You have a source and
  sink node given as input, and you need to provide the shortest path that links
  them up.  (Yes, you could get the answer using Dijkstra's algorthim to get the
  same answer - bidirectional search typically uses less memory and takes less
  time).  The pseudocode goes like this:</p>

<ol>
  <li> Given <b>SOURCE</b> and <b>SINK</b>, initialize set <b>S</b> and <b>T</b> with <b>SOURCE</b> and <b>SINK</b>, respectively.
  <li> While the intersection of <b>SOURCE</b> and <b>SINK</b> is empty:
    <ol>
      <li> For each <b>x</b> in <b>S</b>, add its neighbors to <b>S</b>
      <li> For each <b>y</b> in <b>T</b>, add its neighbors to <b>T</b>
    </ol>
  <li> Return the shortest path that goes though the intersection of <b>S</b>
  and <b>T</b>.
</ol>

<h3> Data </h3>

<p>There is adjacency information available here:<br/>
/umd-lin/jbg/data/movies/actor2actors/<br/>
Each line represents an person, which is the first field (separated by a tab).
All of the other names on the line (separated by pipes) are other people they
have worked with on a movie.  The letters in parentheses discriminate actors
vs. writers vs. directors.
</p>

<h3>Questions</h3>

<ol>

  <li> Describe your algorithm, covering how you: </li>
    <ol>
      <li> Represent Nodes
      <li> Handle serialization
      <li> Detect Termination
      <li> Distinguish the source from the sink
    </ol>

 <li> Compute some paths! </li>
  <ol>
    <li> What is the path between "Hanks, Tom (a)" and "Bacon, Kevin (I) (a)"?
  (Hint: this is super-easy and should be a sanity check.)
  
    <li> What is the path between "Murray, Bill (I) (a)" and "Bacon, Kevin (I) (a)"?
    
    <li> What is the path between "Schreck, Max (a)" (who played Nosferatu, one of
  the first and best film vampires) and "Bacon, Kevin (I) (a)"?
  
    <li> What is the path between "Jun, Gianna (a)" (who played Saya, a
  vampire-hunter in one of the worst recent vampire movies) and "Bacon, Kevin
  (I) (a)"
  
    <li> What is the path between "Schreck, Max (a)" and "Jun, Gianna (a)"?
  </ol>

  <li> Can you find a longer path than any of the ones you found above? (We're not asking you to compute the diameter of the graph, just play around and demonstrate a path longer than the ones above.) </li>

  <li> How would your code change if the edges were weighted?  (e.g. if
  television counted less than movies, or if weighting was by billing) </li>
  
</ol>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 11:59pm, Thursday 4/14.  Please send us
(both Jordan and Yingying) an email with "[CCC Assignment 5]" as the
subject.  In the body of the email put answers to the questions above
and any source code you created or modified.</p>


<h3>Hints / Tips</h3>

<ul>

  <li> Dumbo does not have an easy way of accessing counters in driver programs,
  so determing convergence in Dumbo might be difficult (if you can figure out
  how, great, otherwise, you might want to consider the more mature Java
  interface).</li>

  <li> Before debugging on the whole dataset, first check to make sure you can
  handle <a href="sample.txt">small data</a>.</li>

  <li> Be sure to differentiate between your two types of search frontiers.</li>

  <li> Don't forget that you'll need to be able to recover the actual paths you
  discovered.</li>

  <li> Be sure that you handle disconnected graphs well (think about how you'd
  detect that your algorithm isn't making progress). </li> 

  <li> Nodes might not be unique - be careful! </li>

</ul>
