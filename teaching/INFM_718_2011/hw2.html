<h2>Assignment 2: Translation Probabilities</h2>
  
<p><b>Due:</b> Thursday 3/3 (11:59pm)</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

  <p>Machine translation is the general term for attempt to turn text in one
  language (e.g. English) into another (e.g. French).  Statistical machine
  translation uses large collections of parallel documents to <i>learn</i>
  statistical rules about how to turn one language into another.</p>


  <p>This course is not about machine translation, but this assignment will
  compute probabilities that are used in machine translation systems.  If you're
  interested in learning more, you can take a look
  at <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/465/PowerPoint/lect32a-mt-word-based-models.pdf">these
  slides;</a> we're going to be doing the M-step of IBM Model One (if that's
  gibberish to you, that's okay; we'll explain exactly what we mean).</p>

<h3>Lexical translation probabilities</h3>

  <p>Translation systems are built on top of parallel texts, where you have
  the <b>exact same</b> text written in multiple languages.  An example of such
  a corpus are the <a href="http://www.statmt.org/europarl/">transcripts of the
  European Union parliament</a>, which by law have to be translated in many
  languages.</p>

  <p>Machine translation systems need to learn the probability of translating
  one word to another.  We can learn the probability of translations by looking
  at how many times a word in the source language is translated into various
  words in the target language.</p>

  <p>In the files provided here, we have the English words aligned with French
  words in the Europarl corpus.  (You might be asking how we get the alignments
  - it's a chicken and egg problem that we're ignoring for the purpos of this
  assignment).</p>
  
<h3>What the data look like</h3>

  <p>Each record in the data located in /umd-lin/jbg/data/europarl/ looks like:</p>

    <blockquote>
      englishword1::frenchword1 englishword2::frenchword2 englishword3::frenchword3
    </blockquote>

    <p>as you can see, the alignment is already done for you.  Your goal is to
    compute the probability of computing an English word into every French word.</p>

<h3>Required tasks</h3>

  <p>To complete this assignment, you will need to:
    <ol>
      <li> Fill in the missing pieces of the two classes:
        <ul>
          <li> src/dist/edu/umd/cloud9/example/translation/TransProbMapper.java
          <li> src/dist/edu/umd/cloud9/example/translation/TransProbReducer.java
        </ul>
      <li> (Optional, but encouraged) Make sure that these classes pass the unit
      tests located in the same directory.  The tests may make slightly
      different assumptions than you did; that's okay.  You don't have to pass
      all the tests, you may want to change the tests to match your assumptions
      and make sure you pass <b>those</b> tests.  It's much easier to debug on
      unit tests than on the cluster.
      <li> Write a driver to set the mapper and reducer.  Consider if you need
      other classes (e.g. partitioner, combiner).  Run the algorithm locally on
      a small dataset to make sure it works.
      <li> Run the algorithm on the Europarl dataset.  It should take no longer
      than 10 minutes; if it takes longer than that, you've likely done
      something inefficient.
    </ol>
  </p>
  
    <p>When you're done with these, answer the following questions about your
    results:</p>
    <ol>
      <li> How many unique English words are there?
      <li> For the English word "house," how many French words is it translated
    into?
      <li> What is the probability of "house" being translated as:
        <ol>
          <li> maison
          <li> assembl&eacute;e
          <li> ici
          <li> h&eacute;micycle
          <li> parlement
        </ol>
      <li> What are examples of non-identical, unambiguous words that appear more than once?
    (e.g. "whites" is translated as "blancs" every time it appears, so "whites"
    is an example.  "airways" is always translated as "airways", but it's the
    same in English and French, so it is not an example.)
      <li> What's an example of a word that is translated a different way every
    time it appears? (e.g. "hogwash" (nonsense) is translated as both
    "aberration" and "transparente" the two times it appears).
    </ol>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 11:59pm, Thursday 3/3.  Please send us (both Jordan
and Yingying) an email with "[CCC Assignment 2]" as the subject.  In the body of
the email put answers to the questions above and attach the any source code that
you modified or created.</p>
  
<p><b>Note:</b> The Google/IBM cluster is a shared resource accessible
by many.  Any impropriety on the cluster will be taken very seriously.
This includes tampering or attempting to tamper with another student's
results, attempting to pass another student's result as one's own,
etc.  See the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic
Integrity or the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Hints</h2>

   <ul>
     <li> Don't ignore the unit tests.  They aren't just busywork.
     <li> Think about what keys go to which reducers and in what order.  Build
     checks (e.g. by throwing an assumption) that enforce your assumptions to
     make sure they hold.
     <li> Your output should be probabilities and should have all the properties
     of probabilities (e.g. non-negative, sum to 1).  If they don't, you have
     problems.
     <li> The "order inversion" paradigm will likely be helpful.
     <li> For the questions, there's no reason you can't write seperate programs
     to calculate the answers.
   </ul>
