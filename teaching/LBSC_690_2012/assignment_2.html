<h1>LBSC 690: Introduction to Information Technology</h1>

<h2>Assignment 2</h2>

<p>This assignment is worth 30 points.  It is due at 11:59PM on October 24.

<p>There are two possible scenarios for this assignment:</p>
<UL>
  <LI>You are the media specialist in an elementary school.  You have been asked
to develop a new Web interface to assist children in locating library resources
and other resources on the Web.</LI>
  <LI>You need to build a webpage for yourself to showcase your talents for a
  future employer</LI>
</UL>

<P>If you choos the first option, here are some examples of sites with similar purpose:</P>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.prge.lib.md.us/">PG County Library Catalog</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://libcat.arlingtonva.us/iii/encore/search/C__Sf%3Aa+y%3A%5B2011-2012%5D__Ff%3Afacetcollections%3A1%3A1%3AFiction%3A%3A__Ff%3Afacetcollections%3A4%3A4%3AFor%25252BKids%3A%3A__Orightresult?lang=eng&suite=pearl">Arlington Public Library's Kids Catalog</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.ipl.org/div/kidspace/">KidSpace at the Internet Public Library</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.childrensbooksonline.org/">Children's Books Online: The Rosetta Project</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.childrenslibrary.org/icdl/TextSearch?ilang=English">ICDL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Regardless of which scenario you explore, keep in mind the interaction issues
discussed in class, for example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is the navigation consistent?</li>
  <li>Do users always know where they are?</li>
  <li>Is it easy to get lost?</li>
  <li>How well is the site organized?</li>
  <li>How is content organized?</li>
  <li>Is it easy to tell what's where?</li>
</ul>

<p>Based on what you think is effective and ineffective in these
digital resources, develop a Web interface to support elementary-age
children in finding books in your collection as well as resources
online (decide what online resource you think are appropriate!).
"Develop a Web interface" as in create a mock-up; for example, the
search functionality doesn't have to work, links don't necessary have
to go anywhere.  The Web mock-up should contain at least <b>three pages</b>
and demonstrate understanding of user interface design principles
discussed in class.</p>

<p>Your webpage must use CSS; to demonstrate how much of an effect the CSS has,
create a version of at least one page page that doesn't use your CSS (but is
otherwise identical), and include a link to a "no css" version.</p>

<p>Points will be awarded based on the following (each worth 3 points):</p>
<ul>
  <li> <b>Correct number of pages</b>
  <li> <b>Links work</b>
  <li> <b>Clean, consistent navigation</b>
  <li> <b>Good use of CSS</b>
  <li> <b>Use of an image</b>
  <li> <b>Clean layout of code</b>
  <li> <b>Use of advanced structures (e.g. lists, tables)</b>
  <li> <b>Use of comments in code</b>
  <li> <b>Tasteful variety in display and presentation</b>
  <li> <b>Reasonable titles and filenames</b>
</ul>

<p>Don't fixate on content unless you want to; you will not be explicitly graded
on content.  However, if including content makes the task easier or more
rewarding for you, then that's great.</p>

<p>This assignment should be placed online in your TerpConnect account.  Send me
an e-mail with two links, one to a version of your webpage that uses CSS and one
that does not (the difference between the two should be trivial - one will be
lacking a link to your css file).  Make sure that the subject of the e-mail
begins with [LBSC690 Assignment2].</p>
