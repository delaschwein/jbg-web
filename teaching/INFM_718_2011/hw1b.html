<h2>Assignment 1b: Getting started on Hadoop at scale</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.example.simple.DemoWordCount /tmp/wiki /tmp/jbg-course/cnt2-USERNAME 50
</BLOCKQUOTE>

  
<p><b>Due:</b> Tuesday 2/22 (11:59pm)</p>


<p>The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with running Hadoop on
the Google/IBM cluster.  It is the sequel to <a
 href="hw1a.html">Assignment 1-1</a> and builds directly on it.</p>

<p>First, let's <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/content/start-Google-cluster.html">start with the Google/IBM cluster</a>.  You should have
received separate instructions on account creation.  Remember, when
selecting a username, please prefix the username by "ccc_", so that,
for example, I would be "ccc_jbg".  This allows us to distinguish
students in the class from other cluster users.</p>

<p>On the cluster, we've prepped a raw text dump of Wikipedia for you
to play with:</p>

<pre>
hadoop fs -ls /tmp/wiki
</pre>

<p>You can check out the contents with something like this:</p>

<pre>
hadoop fs -cat /tmp/wiki/part-00000 | head
</pre>

<p>Now, run the word count demo on this dataset, with 100 reducers:</p>

<pre>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.example.simple.DemoWordCount /tmp/wiki /tmp/jbg-course/cnt1-USERNAME 100
</pre>

<p>Substitute USERNAME with your actual username <b>without</b> the
"ccc_" prefix. Therefore, I would put the output in
/tmp/jbg-course/cnt1-jbg.  It is important that you follow these
instructions <b>exactly</b>, because this is where we are going to
look for your output.</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> What is your job id?  If you ran the code more
than once, any job id of a successful run will do.</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> How large is the input data? (Hint, look in the jobtracker
webapp.)</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> How many map tasks does your job contain?</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> What is the 6th word in part-00042 and how many
times does it appear?</p>

<p>You'll notice that there is a lot of "junk" in the output.  Let's
try to clean this up by throwing away terms that don't appear often.
Modify the word count demo so to retain only words that occur more
than 100 times (i.e., cnt > 100).</p>

<p>Once you've modified the program (remember to remake the jar
file!), run it again:</p>

<pre>
hadoop jar cloud9.jar edu.umd.cloud9.example.simple.DemoWordCount /tmp/wiki /tmp/jbg-course/cnt2-USERNAME 10
</pre>

<p>This time, use only 10 reducers.  Note the slightly different path
in which to put your results.</p>

<p><b>Question 5.</b> How many terms appear more than 100 times in the
collection?</p>

<p><b>Question 6.</b> How many time does "life" appear in the
collection?</p>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>


<p>This assignment is due by 11:59pm, Tuesday 2/22.  Please send us (both Jordan
and Yingying) an email with "[CCC Assignment 1b]" as the subject.  In the body
of the email put answers to the questions above.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The Google/IBM cluster is a shared resource accessible
by many.  Any impropriety on the cluster will be taken very seriously.
This includes tampering or attempting to tamper with another student's
results, attempting to pass another student's result as one's own,
etc.  See the <a href="http://www.shc.umd.edu/">Code of Academic
Integrity or the Student Honor Council</a> for more information.</p>

   <ul>
     <li> The support page for the cluster has <a href="https://univsupport.hipods.ihost.com/clusters/4/">examples</a> of configuration files you can download if you don't have luck with <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/content/start-Google-cluster.html">these instructions</a>.
