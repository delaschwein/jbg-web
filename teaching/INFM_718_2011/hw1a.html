<h2>Assignment 1a: Getting started on Hadoop</h2>

<p><b>Due:</b> Thursday 2/10 (11:59pm)</p>

<p>The primary purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with
running Hadoop in two different ways: in standalone mode and in the
Cloudera VM.  You will be asked to work through a few tutorials.  The
assignment does not involve actual coding, but requires a lot of
activity on the command line (running Hadoop jobs, copying files
around, etc.).  This is the first part of a two-part assignment: in
the second part, you'll run Hadoop on the Google/IBM cluster.</p>

<p>The secondary purpose of this assignment is to make sure that you
have sufficient background to take this course.  This assignment is
written in such a way that you should be able to figure out details
that we have omitted (for example, on downloading, configuring, and
installing software).  Also note: machines are configured in slightly
different ways, and as a result you may run into issues that require
troubleshooting (e.g., differences in install paths, environment
settings, etc.).  We expect that you have sufficient familiarity with
general operating system concepts to be able to solve most issues
yourself.  If you are having a lot of trouble completing this
assignment, you might not be ready for the course.</p>

<p>For this class, we'll be
using <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/">Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a>,
a Hadoop library developed at Maryland both for this course and for
research in text processing.  The first goal of this assignment is to
get the word count demo in Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> running in
standalone mode.  In standalone mode, Hadoop runs in a single thread
on your local machine.  Do the following:</p>

<ul>

  <li>First, download the Hadoop
  version: <a href="http://archive.cloudera.com/cdh/testing/hadoop-0.20.1+152.tar.gz">0.20.1</a>.
  Unpack it somehwere where you can get to it, and make sure that you can run
  "hadoop" from the command line.</li>

  <li>Next, <a href="https://github.com/jordanbg/Cloud9">download
  and
set up Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup></a>.  Note that you can either download a
  repository or clone the github repository (if you clone the repo using git, it
  will be easier for future assignments).</li>

  <li>Then, work through the tutorial
  on <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jimmylin/cloud9/docs/content/start-standalone.html">getting
  started in standalone mode</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now, answer the following questions:</p>

<p><b>Question 1.</b> Have you successfully completed the above
tutorials and run the word count demo in standalone mode?  (<i>yes</i>
or <i>no</i>)</p>

<p>Look at the output in demo/part-00000.</p>

<p><b>Question 2.</b> What's the next term found in the collection
after <code>''my</code>? How many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 3.</b> Scan down the output a few more lines: how many times does
<code>'and</code> appear in the collection?</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> It is very important to understand that in standalone
mode, there is no HDFS.</p>

<p>The second goal of this assignment is to get the word count demo
running inside
the <a href="http://www.cloudera.com/hadoop-training-virtual-machine">Cloudera
VM</a>.  Follow the instructions on the page to download the image and
also VMware Player (for Windows and Linux) or VMware Fusion (for Mac).
Start up the VM.  <b>Important: while 0.3.3 will work for this assignment, in
the future we will be using features only in 0.3.4, so save yourself trouble
later and install 0.3.4 (0.3.3 also is running the Ubuntu version Intrepid Ibex,
which is no longer supported, so you can't do apt-get)</b>.  </p>

<p>Inside the VM, Hadoop is running in what's called
"pseudo-distributed mode", which means that all the daemon processes
(JT, NN, TT) are running on the same machine and communicating via
loopback.  Inside the VM, open up a browser, and you should see the
Hadoop webapps.</p>

<p>Your task is to now run the Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> word
count demo inside the VM.  The requires that you copy over the data
(bible+shakes.nopunc) to the VM.  Once the data is inside the VM,
you'll need to put the data into HDFS.  You'll also need to copy the
Cloud<sup><small>9</small></sup> jar onto the VM.  Once you've done
all of this, you can now submit a Hadoop job.  Run word count example
on the bible+shakes.nopunc data with 5 reducers.  Answer the following
questions:</p>

<p><b>Question 4.</b> Have you successfully run the word count demo
inside the Cloudera VM on the sample dataset? (<i>yes</i>
or <i>no</i>)</p>

<p><b>Question 5.</b> What is the first term in part-00000 and how
many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 6.</b> What is the third to last term in part-00004 and
how many times does it appear?</p>

<p><b>Question 7.</b> How long did it take you to complete this
assignment?</p>

<p><b>Hints:</b></p>

<ul>

  <li>Copying the data onto the Cloudera VM does not mean that the
  data is placed into HDFS.  That requires a second step.</li>

  <li>Here is
  a <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.20.1/hdfs_user_guide.html">user
  guide for HDFS commands</a>.</li>

  <li>It your job to figure out how to get data from your local
  machine onto the Cloudera VM.  Think about using scp and
  ifconfig.</li>

  <li>If you have trouble getting network connectivity in your VM, try deleting
  <b>/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</b> and restarting the
  system.</li>

  <li>If you're using <a
  href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>, try installing
  an extension pack.  It makes the resolution tolerable. (You have to mount the
  virtual CD to the VM).</li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 11:59pm, Thursday 2/10.  Please send us (both
Jordan and Yingying) an email with "[CCC Assignment
1a]" as the subject.  In the body of the email put answers to the
questions above.</p>

<p><b>Important:</b> Follow these instructions exactly as specified.
This means exactly the subject line indicated above and answers in the
email message itself (<i>not</i> as an attachment).</p>
