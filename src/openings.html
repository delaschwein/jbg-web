<h2>Positions Available in my Group</h2>

<p>Boulder is a wonderful place to live and to do research.  It's
consistently ranked <a
href="https://bouldercolorado.gov/newsroom/best-of-boulder-community-honors">one
of the best places</a> to study, live, and to raise a family.  It's
home to many <a
href="http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2013/08/14/boulder-colo-most-popular-city-for-tech-startups-study-says/">high
tech startups</a>, and one of the best places for studying natural
language processing; it's also home to Jim Martin and Martha Palmer,
giants in NLP.</p>

<h3>Postdocs</h3>

<p>No current openings.</p>

<h3>Graduate Students</h3>

<p>I have openings for one fully funded graduate student for Fall
2017.  Overall strength
of <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/how-apply">application</a>
matters more than specific research area, but I'm looking for someone
with a track record of applying advanced machine learning techniques
to language.</p>

<h3>Undergraduates</h3>

<p>I'm interested in hosting undergraduates from leading institutions,
but only if an introduction is made through <b>a faculty member that I
know</b> and who can vouch for the student.  I'm also only able to
fund US citizens.</p>

<h3>High School Students</h3>

<p>I'm only interested in working with high school students in the Boulder /
Denver area.  They must: already know how to program in Python, have an
existing, demonstrated interest in the areas that I work in, and be extremely
motivated.</p>

<p>Once a student contacts me, I will assign a relatively trivial programming task
to them that requires them to understand and modify an existing piece of code.
This is a necessary prerequisite to working with me and has a one-week time
limit.  (Thus, do not contact me if you are not going to have any free time over
the next few weeks.)</p>

<p>I know this seems like a lot of hassle, but I want to make sure
that the students I work with are ready to get to work immediately.
Funding is possible, but only after a one-month trial period.</p>
