and Their Effects on Manually Generated Labels

~~ abstract | Probabilistic topic models are important tools for
indexing, summarizing, and analyzing large document collections by their
themes.  However, promoting end-user understanding of topics remains an open
research problem.  We compare labels generated by users given four topic
visualization techniques—word lists, word lists with bars, word clouds,
and network graphs—against each other and against automatically generated
labels.  Our basis of comparison is participant ratings of how well labels
describe documents from the topic. Our study has two phases: a labeling
phase where participants label visualized topics and a validation phase
where different participants select which labels best describe the topics'
documents.  Although all visualizations produce similar quality labels,
simple visualizations such as word lists allow participants to quickly
understand topics, while complex visualizations take longer but expose
multi-word expressions that simpler visualizations obscure.  Automatic
labels lag behind user-created labels, but our dataset of manually labeled
topics highlights linguistic patterns (e.g., hypernyms, phrases) that can be
used to improve automatic topic labeling algorithms.
