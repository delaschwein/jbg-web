<h1>LBSC 690: Final Project</h1>

<h2>Final Project</h2>

<p>The final project is due on the last day of class, December 10, 2012.  

<h2>LBSC 690: Final Project</h2> 

<p>The final project is designed to provide you an opportunity to integrate and
extend knowledge acquired throughout the course and to apply that knowledge to
solve a problem of substantial scope.  You should work in groups of two or three
(three is suggested).  You should plan to devote time approximately equal to two
homework assignments (multiplied by three people).  Experience suggests that
successful teams require expertise in design, implementation, and project
management.</p>

<p>Accompanying each project will be a presentation Monday, 12/12.
Each group will get ten minutes to present their work, followed by
five minutes for questions.</p> 
 
<p>Projects are required to make substantial use of at least two of
the following technologies introduced in the course, integrated in a
manner that is appropriate for the intended application:</p> 
 
<ul> 
  <li>Web-based content delivery (HTML with CSS)</li> 
  <li>XML</li> 
  <li>Relational databases</li> 
  <li>Multimedia content</li> 
  <li>Programming (e.g. -- but not limited to -- JavaScript)</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Projects must be designed to address an information-related problem
and are required to have substantial content. If you have questions
regarding scope, please ask me.</p> 
 
<p>It is recommended that you structure your ten-minute presentation
into two separate parts, a presentation and a demo of your
project (although how long you devote to each would depend on the
project).  Your presentation should address the following
questions:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>What problem did you solve?</li> 
 
<li>How did you figure out what exactly was needed?</li> 
 
<li>How did you organize your group?  Who did what?</li> 
 
<li>How well does the project deliver on what it was designed to
   accomplish?</li> 
 
<li>What did you learn about the nature of your problem?</li> 
 
<li>What did you learn about the capabilities and limitations of the
   technologies that you chose to work with?</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Of course, different groups will devote more or less time to each
of these, and some groups will add other things.  There is no cookbook
recipe for a good project.  The key is to learn a lot, and to describe
what you have learned!</p> 
 
<h3>Grading</h3> 
 
<p>The final project will be worth a sizeable portion of your total grade.  The
breakdown of the grade will be as follows:</p> 
 
<CENTER>
<table cellpadding="5" border="1"> 
<tr><td width="150"><b>Criteria</b></td><td><b>Points</b></td></tr> 
<tr><td>Content
<ul>
  <li> Is the project a good idea?
  <li> Do you have a workable solution?
  <li> How much did you think about it?
</ul>

</td><td>3</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Technology

<ul>
  <li> Did you use the right tools?
  <li> Did they work?
  <li> Can you expand it easily?
</ul>

</td><td>6</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Interface

<ul>
  <li> Can somebody use it?
  <li> Does it look nice?
  <li> How robust is it?
</ul>

</td><td>3</td></tr> 
<tr><td>Oral Presentation

<ul>
  <li> Did you answer the questions above?
  <li> Did you take less than 10 minutes?
  <li> How well did you excite folks?
</ul>

</td><td>3</td></tr> 
<tr><td><b>Total</b></td><td>15</td></tr>
