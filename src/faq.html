<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Prospective Students</h3>

<p class="question"> I want to work with you, and I'm currently a
student at the University of Colorado.</a>

<p class="answer">First, take natural language processing, machine
learning, probabilistic models of human and machine intelligence, or
data mining.  Once you've done
that, <a href="http://jbg.youcanbook.me">schedule a meeting</a>, and
we'll figure out a project to work on together.  After we finish the
project, we can discuss longer-term arrangments.</p>

<p class="question">I want to work with you, and I'm not currently a student at
Colorado</p>

<p class="answer">Then you should apply to be a student at Colorado.
The best way would be to apply to
the <a href="http://www.colorado.edu/cs/admissions/how-apply">computer
science</a> and mention me specifically in your application.  After
you submit an application, please drop me an e-mail (put GRADAPP-20XX
in the subject) with your CV letting me know you applied.  I may not
reply, but it's still very useful!</p>

<p class="answer">To help me quickly search for such e-mails (and to show that
  you've done your homework by reading this FAQ), please put GRADAPP-20XX in the
  subject line, where XX is the year you hope to enroll.</p>

<p class="question">How many <a name="students"></a>students do you plan to admit this year?</p>

<p class="answer">For Fall 2016, <a href="openings.html">I hope to
admit up to one to two PhD students</a>.

<p class="question">Are grad students at Colorado funded?</p>

<p class="answer">The University of Colorado, like all top American
universities, makes a commitment to fund students so long as they're
making adequate progress.  This includes supporting tuition, a
stipend, and health insurance.  Colorado, unlike the coasts, also
tends to be a bit cheaper, which means your stipend goes further.</p>

<p class="question">Do you have any postdocs available?</p>

<p class="answer">I'm fairly junior, so I'm trying to fund students right now.
I'm fairly good about keeping my webpage updated, so if I am publicly looking
for a postdoc it will be under the <b>news</b> section on my homepage.</p>

<p class="question">  I want to work with you, and I'm currently a student at UMD</p>

<p class="answer">I moved to the University of Colorado in August
2014.  I will no longer be advising new students at the University of
Maryland.</p>

<p class="question">Can I work with you as an intern?</p>

<p class="answer">Unfortunately, it's very hard to evaluate the quality of
candidates without a formal system (e.g., as we have for university admissions).
As a result, it is my policy only to work with people directly recommended to me
by a professor or researcher <b>with whom I already have a relationship</b>.</p>

<p class="question">Will get admitted?  Why was I rejected?  What do you think
of School/Progam X?</p>

<p class="answer">I will not answer this sort of question. Don't even bother
asking.  I cannot give opinions on whether you will get accepted without seeing
a full application. There are numerous venues where you can get <a
 href="http://thegradcafe.com/">uninformed opinions</a> <a
 href="http://quora.com">about your chances</a>.  In any given year, which
students I accept depends on funding amounts, match between project and
students, and who says yes or no and when. It's a very stochastic process, and
<a
 href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-graduate-school-admissions">I
wish we had a more logical system</a>.</p>

<p class="question">Can I have a fee waiver?</p>

<p class="answer">This is a bit of a misnomer.  Fee waivers do not mean the
fee is waived.  It means that <b>I</b> pay it for a prospective student.  I'm
happy to do so for a very strong student, but cannot do so for many students.
If this is an issue, please write in an e-mail (with GRADAPP-20XX in the
subject) that you <b>request a fee waiver</b>.  If I reply explicitly
saying <b>I will pay your application fee</b>, then you may check the fee waiver
box on your application.  Otherwise, I'm very sorry, but I cannot help that many
applicants with their application fees.</p>

<h3>Current Students</h3>

<p class="question">Can you give me a letter of reference?</p>

<p class="answer">I typically only write letters for students whose
committee I've served on, whom I've worked on a research project with,
or who did very well in my class.  Unless you are my direct advisee,
you <b>must</b> ask me before giving my name out.</p>

<p class="answer">When you ask, please send a list of bulleted points
that answers the following questions: how we know each other
(e.g. took class X, recieved grade Y, completed project on Z), what
research we have worked on (what the project was about, where it was
published, your role in the project).  Good rec letters contain
details, and the more details you can provide that I can then surround
with context, the better your letter will be.</p>

<p class="question">What are your expectations / preferences in terms
of what a student should know?</p>

<p class="answer">
I personally like C++ and Python, but the culture here leans to Java,
which I've been using more and more (and likely will continue to).  I
prefer writing tests to debugging, but debugging is a necessary evil.
I do like reinventing the wheel somewhat to keep things self-contained
and consistent, but I contribute the result to things
like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nltk">NLTK</a> so that other
people don't have to do the same.  I also like using style checkers
and the like to keep myself organized.  (Though I say this, you can
get a more honest picture of my coding style by looking at what I've
actually written.)</p>

<p class="answer">Students who want to work with me should</p>
<ol>
  <li> have basic knowledge of Python, C++, <b>or</b> Java (e.g. be able to write a
  dynamic program in that language),
  <li> understand probability (Bayes rule, conditional probabilities, smoothing),
  <li> compile LaTeX documents using BibTeX, and
  <li> use version control software (e.g. git or svn)
</ol>
<p class="answer">These are the bare <b>minimum</b> requirements.  If
you do not meet these requirements, please take some classes to
acquire these skills (preferably mine!) before asking to collaborate
on research.</p>

<p class="answer">You should already code in <b>some</b> language pretty well,
and conforming to my coding style will increase the probability that I'll be
more hands-on in helping you code and debug, but if you want to program in LISP
or Prolog, that's perfectly fine too, as long as it works for you.</p>

<p class="answer">Being comfortable with probability is probably the more
important requirement.  You'll likely have to deal with messy probability
distributions, take expectations, derive conditional distributions given a joint
distribution, implement dynamic programing to sample from PCFG grammars, do
Taylor approximations, do some optimizations, etc.  This shouldn't be taken as a
laundry list of things you should know (it's great if you do) but just as a
heads up of the kinds of things you might run into; part of a graduate education
(life, for that matter) is learning new stuff.  There will be many opportunities
to learn: from classes (at Colorado: NLP [Martin/Palmer]; Machine Learning [Me];
and Deep Learning [Mozer]), your peers, and reading group.</p>

<p class="answer">I think attending (and contributing to) a reading
group or two is critical for learning about a field and being a good
scholar; it's fun and not a chore at all, but I want to be up front in
saying that any student of mine should be an active participant in a
reading group or two.</p>

<p class="answer">Reading groups are also important for being able to
"look smart" when you're interviewing.  You'll need to be able to
connect your work to what other people do.  A reading group lets you
know how your thesis connects to other research topics and talk
intelligently about them.  Unfortunately, this can't be done quickly;
it requires dedication over many years to learn about the breadth of
research that folks explore.  So while you might feel like skipping
reading group once is a good decision to get more work done, it's
ultimately a bad decision because you need to consistently go to
understand a broad range of topics.</p>

<p class="question">How do you interact with students?</p>

<p class="answer">I like to have a group meeting every other week with students
I'm working with (broadly construed), and one-on-one meetings as needed with
students.  I use Google calendar to <a href="http://jbg.youcanbook.me">set up my
appointments</a>, so students can grab a meeting whenever they need to.  I
expect students working with me full time to meet with me on average once a week
(sometimes much more, such as before a paper deadline, and sometimes less).  I
use this online system so that my meetings are contiguous and that students
always know when I'm available (and I can change things without e-mail).
Students should sign up for a meeting at least 24 hours in advance.  It's okay
to schedule meetings outside of that time, but that should be the exception (I
try to maximize the amount of contiguous time I have to research, write, and
think).</p>

<p class="answer">In addition, everyone in my group (me included) sends a weekly e-mail to everybody saying:
<ul>
  <li class="answer"> What they worked on that week </li>
  <li class="answer"> What they plan to work on next week </li>
  <li class="answer"> Anything that's holding them up or blocking their progress </li>
</ul></p>
<p class="answer">Anyone who is working for me full time or who is my direct
advisee <b>must</b> send me such an e-mail (with the subject [Weekly Snippet
YYYY MM DD]) sometime on Monday Eastern time.  I find that this is very helpful
because I sometimes ask myself (or have funding agencies ask me) what I (and my
students) did in a particular time period.  These e-mails really help me figure
that out without bugging other people.  It also helps me stay productive by
setting realistic goals; I use this weekly todo list to populate my daily todo
list.</p>

<p class="answer">Outside of that, I prefer face-to-face communication (when I'm
not sitting down at my computer being productive) or e-mail as a communication
mechanism.  Instant messages are also sometimes okay for quick questions, but
never send an e-mail and then ask via IM "Did you see my e-mail?"</p>

<p class="question">I need you to do something (look over a draft,
send an e-mail, etc.).  How should I best make sure that happens?</p>

<p class="answer">The most important thing is to make sure it's on my
radar.  If you have an important deadline, make sure it appears in
your snippet that you send me weekly.  I will make sure I budget my
time to ensure that it gets taken care of.  Give me as much warning as
possible.  I get grumpy if I have to rearrange my schedule for you at
the last minute.</p>

<p class="answer">It's fine (and helpful) for you to remind me.
However, I'd like to make the following caveats.  Unless the deadline
is hours away, the best way is over e-mail; not phone or IM.  It's
less intrusive and I have systems for dealing with tasks that arrive
over e-mail.  The frequency of the reminder is also important.  No
more than once every five days, I would suggest.</p>

<p class="answer">Finally, make it as easy as possible for me to do
what you need me to do.  Have your reminder e-mail reference all of
the material I need to do the task.  If I'm reviewing a paper, remind
me where in the repository it lives and send me a compiled PDF.  If I
need to write a letter, provide the background material and the
contact information in one place.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p class="question">I'm trying to use your code, but I'm having
trouble.  How should I get help?</p>

<p class="answer">E-mail all of the people who worked on the paper associated
with the code with
<ol>
   <li> a minimal (simple as possible) example that can replicate your problem;
   <li> the inputs that replicate your problem (again, this should be as simple
   as possible; sending multi-megabyte files is usually not minimal);
   <li> exactly what you did (the exact command line used);
   <li> what you expected to see;
   <li> what you got instead (include error messages and any output); and
   <li> what versions of various resources you're using (NLTK, Java, gcc, boost,
   protocol buffers, etc.).
</ol></p>

<p class="answer">This information is necessary for us to help you with your
problem.  The simpler it is to replicate your problem, the faster you will get a
response.  More complicated setup take longer for us to try out and debug.  If
your example is simple enough, we can often see the problem ourselves without
running code.</p>

<p class="answer">Each e-mail should be self-contained.  All the information to
reproduce the bug should be in one place. This helps us quickly reproduce the
bug, and it also ensures that you've not tweaked anything that might prevent us
from isolating the issue.</p>

<p class="question">What's up with your name?  Why is it hyphenated?
  What should I call you?</p>

<p class="answer">My parents' last names are Boyd and Graber.  When I
was born they hyphenated (why people whose nicknames were "Toni the
Body" and "Little Grabber" would do so is beyond me; my nickname is
obvious).  As a result, I am deeply, personally, against hyphenating
names.  Don't do it.  It's not a sustainable practice, and it leads to
all sorts of problems.  People think my last name is just "Boyd" or
"Graber", web forms don't think I have a valid name, and there's only
about a forty percent chance someone will get my name right after one
telling.</p>

<p class="answer">Most people call me Jordan, which is just fine by me.  I
also answer to JBG.</p>

<p class="question">I'm a TA or grader for one of your courses; what do I need to know?</p>

<ol>
  <li> First, make sure that we have a meeting before the semester starts.
  <li> Attend at least a class or two to get a feel of what's going on.
  <li> As each assignment is posted, look it over to make sure I haven't done
  anything stupid (e.g., a confusing problem); it will make your life easier.
  <li> Once assignments arrive, create an ontology of all of the mistakes that
  people have made (do this before you start "grading"); this will allow you to
  fairly and consistently deduct points.
  <li> Using that ontology, create a template that you can use to provide
  feedback to students (e.g. by copy/paste or deleting).  This allows you to
  explain each mistake in detail without having to retype the same thing over
  and over again.  It also ensures that you give consistent feedback for each
  mistake people make.
  <li> Post a synopsis of the mistakes that people made and how to correct them.
  <li> Never give a grade without explaining why people got the grade they did.
</ol>

<p class="question">Why did you leave the University of Maryland?</p>

<p class="answer"> This was a very difficult decision.  The biggest
factor was to be near family (I was born in Colorado, and that's where
most of my family is).</p>

<p class="answer"> I'm very glad that I had the opportunity to be a
part of Maryland's research environment, and nothing about my move
should be read as a commentary on the University of Maryland (whom I
adore and continue to collaborate with).</p>

<p class="question">What's your Erd&#246;s number?</p>

<p class="answer">While at Princeton, I was also involved with the aphasia
project with Maria Klawe (as a result, I have
an <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erd&#246;s number</a>
of <a href="https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos2.html">2</a>). My
Bacon number is as yet undefined (call me).  </p>
