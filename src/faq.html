<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>FAQ FAQ</h3>

<p class="question">This is really intimidating.  Do you expect all students to have read this before asking you a question?</p>

<p class="answer">No! I've put this here for a couple of reasons:
<ul>
  <li> I get a lot of e-mail.  I want to get less e-mail, so I'm hoping that if people find the answer here, they'll send me less e-mail.
  <li> I get a lot of e-mail.  I want to answer my e-mail quickly, <A HREF="https://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=388">but sometimes I don't</A>.  I'm hoping that if people find the information they need here, they won't have to wait for me to answer.
  <li> Some students are shy about asking questions; if they can find an answer here that they were too afraid to ask, then everyone is better off.
  <li> I want to make sure I treat students fairly.  If I put policies/expectations here, it gives me less leeway for my latent biases to impact students.
</ul>

<h3>Prospective Students</h3>

<p class="question"> I want to work with you, and I'm currently a
grad student at the University of Maryland.  How do I do that?</p>

<p class"answer">In general, the matching process at UMD between
professor and student typically happens during the first year (not
before).  This allows the student to get comfortable and set up within
the university, adjust to the region, and to figure out how much time
they have to devote to research.  This is good because this also lets
you get a sense for the research going on and what the personalities
of the various professors/groups are.</p>

<p class="answer">If you want to work specifically with me, then take
computational linguistics or machine learning (because of the huge
number of students who want to work with me, this
is <b>non-negotiable</b>; it will teach you what you need to know and
will provide me a good sense of your abilities).  Once you've done
that, send me an e-mail with a high-level view of what sorts of things
you're interested in and your courseload for when we'd be working
together (I don't want to work with students who have no time for
research).</p>

<p class="answer"> Then <a href="http://jbg.youcanbook.me">schedule a
meeting</a>, and we'll figure out a project to work on together to
show that you're able to work independently on a self-contained
project.  After we finish the project, we can discuss longer-term
arrangments.</p>

<p class="question"> I want to work with you, and I'm currently an
ungraduate student at the University of Maryland.  How do I do that?</a>

<p class="answer"> First, take either the undergraduate natural language processing
course or the undergraduate machine learning course.  In other words,
you first need to learn how to program and learn some specialized
skills.     But try to take these courses as quickly as you possibly can!</p>

<p class="answer"> <b>Then</b>, send me an e-mail.     I will send you a challenge problem
to complete in about a week.  If you don't have a week to work on a
challenging problem, then wait to e-mail me when you have some time to
work on such a problem (warning: if I'm having a particularly busy
week, I may not get back to you quickly, as putting together a
challenge problem takes some time too).</p>

<p class="answer"> You'll need to sign up to work with me as an independent study.  I'll
also ask you to have a fairly light course load the semester you work
with me, as undergraduate students have a tendency to take on too
much.</p>

<p class="question">I want to work with you, and I'm not currently a
student at Maryland.  How do I work with you?</p>

<p class="answer">Then you should apply to be a student at Maryland.
The best way would be to apply to
 <a href="http://cs.umd.edu/grad/catalog">computer
science</a> and mention me specifically in your application.  After
you submit an application, please drop me an e-mail (put GRADAPP-20XX
in the subject) with your CV letting me know you applied.  I may not
reply, but it's still very useful!</p>

<p class="answer">To help me quickly search for such e-mails (and to show that
  you've done your homework by reading this FAQ), please put GRADAPP-20XX in the
  subject line, where XX is the year you hope to enroll.</p>

<p class="question">How many <a name="students"></a>students do you plan to admit this year?</p>

<p class="answer">See the <a href="openings.html">openings page</a>.

<p class="question">Are PhD students at Maryland funded?</p>

<p class="answer">The University of Maryland, like all top American
universities, makes a commitment to fund PhD students so long as
they're making adequate progress.  This includes supporting tuition, a
stipend, and health insurance.
This is typically through a combination of research assistant positions
and teaching assistant positions (my students typically TA once or
twice).</p>

<p class="question">Can I mention you in my statement of purpose?</p>

<p class="answer">You don't need to specifically ask my permission to
list my name in a statement of purpose so long as our interests are a
good match.  If you think they are, go ahead!  (However, it may not
help you to list me if I'm not taking students in a particular
year.)</p>

<p class="question">Do you have any postdocs available?</p>

<p class="answer">I'm fairly junior, so I'm trying to fund students
right now.  I'm fairly good about keeping my webpage updated, so see
the <a href="openings.html">openings page</a>.</p>

<p class="question"> I want to work with you, and I'm currently a student at
Colorado</p>

<p class="answer">I moved to the University of Maryland in August
2017.  I will no longer be advising new students at the University of
Colorado.</p>

<p class="question">Can I work with you as an intern?</p>

<p class="answer">Unfortunately, it's very hard to evaluate the
quality of candidates without a formal system (e.g., as we have for
university admissions).  As a result, it is my policy only to work
with people directly recommended to me by a professor or
researcher <b>with whom I already have a relationship</b>.</p>

<p class="question">Will I get admitted?  Why was I rejected?</p>

<p class="answer">I will not answer this sort of question. Don't even
bother asking.  I cannot give opinions on whether you will get
accepted without seeing a full application. There are numerous venues
where you can get <a href="http://thegradcafe.com/">uninformed
opinions</a> <a href="http://quora.com">about your chances</a>.  In
any given year, which students I accept depends on funding amounts,
match between project and students, and who says yes or no and
when. It's a very stochastic process, and
<a
 href="http://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-graduate-school-admissions">I
wish we had a more logical system</a>.  </p>

<p class="question">Where should I do my PhD?</p>

<p class="answer">The most important thing
is <A HREF="https://medium.com/@vijayc/how-to-pick-a-grad-school-for-a-phd-in-computer-science-a5ce7dceb246">finding
a PhD program where you will be happy</A>.  Hopefully that will be
UMD; students often put too much weight on rankings.  Don't ignore
rankings, but pay attention to the people involved and your fit with
the group.</p>

<p class="answer">If you absolutely must look at rankings, I
think <a href="CSrankings.org">CSRankings.org</a> are the least bad
rankings available.</p>

<p class="question">Can I do a PhD with you online?</p>

<p class="answer">A PhD is about learning how to be a researcher, and
it's difficult to do that online, in part because much of what you
learn is from your peers, not from a professor.  Unless there's a very
special circumstance (e.g., you're physically working with one of my
existing collaborators), an online PhD is not workable.  Even if it
might work, it puts you at a competitive disadvantage to other
applicants who are willing to physically be present.</p>

<!--
<p class="question">Can I have a fee waiver?</p>

<p class="answer">This is a bit of a misnomer.  Fee waivers do not mean the
fee is waived.  It means that <b>I</b> pay it for a prospective student.  I'm
happy to do so for a very strong student, but cannot do so for many students.
If this is an issue, please write in an e-mail (with GRADAPP-20XX in the
subject) that you <b>request a fee waiver</b>.  If I reply explicitly
saying <b>I will pay your application fee</b>, then you may check the fee waiver
box on your application.  Otherwise, I'm very sorry, but I cannot help that many
applicants with their application fees.</p>

<p>I do provide fee waivers to strong candidates with a disadvantaged
/ nontraditional background.  I (roughly) judge candidate strength
from a CV, but the other criteria require a personal statement that
explains your background.</p>

<p>If it were up to me, I would make grad school admissions free (or
at least based on country/region GDP), but at Colorado it is the
faculty that must pay for fee waivers, so I need to be selective.</p>
-->

<p class="question">You asked me to do a virtual interview after I
applied for a PhD position.  What does that mean and what should I do
to prepare?</p>

<p class="answer">First, it means that you really stood out in the
pool of applicants!  I typically only interview five to ten applicants
a year to select the candidates I will eventually invite to
attend.</p>

<p class="answer">In many ways, it's a sanity check.  If you say in
your application that you're really good at X and you want to do Y,
I'll ask about those things in a little more detail to better
understand your background and your skills.  I'll also ask about what
you want out of a PhD program.</p>

<p class="answer">This really is a two-way conversation, however.
We're going to work with each other for N years, and we both need to
be sure that we can stand each other and work well together.  So it's
important for candidates to ask whatever questions they're concerned
about too.</p>

<h3>Current Students</h3>

<p class="question">Can you give me a letter of reference?</p>

<p class="answer">I typically only write letters for students whose
committee I've served on, whom I've worked on a research project with,
or who did very well in my class.  Unless you are my direct advisee,
you <b>must</b> ask me before giving my name out.</p>

<p class="answer">When you ask, please send a list of bulleted points
that answers the following questions: how we know each other
(e.g. took class X, recieved grade Y, completed project on Z), what
research we have worked on (what the project was about, where it was
published, your role in the project).  Good rec letters contain
details, and the more details you can provide that I can then surround
with context, the better your letter will be.</p>

<p class="answer">For example, if I relied on my memory to write a
letter of recommendation, I would be able to say something like "Susan
took my class and did great, she did a project on music stuff".
That's not as good as "Susan took my class Fall 2015, earned an A, and
presented a final project on distinguishing musical styles
automatically given the waveform of a song.  Their group used a
variety of techniques (support vector machines, convolutional neural
nets, and k-nearest neighbors) to decrease the error rate of a strong
baseline from 0.4 to 0.2".  Obviously the second one is better, but I
can't recall of the details myself.  Your bullet points will help me
recall details and to put your work into context.</p>

<p class="question">What are your expectations / preferences in terms
of what a student should know?</p>

<p class="answer">
I personally like C++ and Python, but the culture here leans to Java,
which I've been using more and more (and likely will continue to).  I
prefer writing tests to debugging, but debugging is a necessary evil.
I do like reinventing the wheel somewhat to keep things self-contained
and consistent, but I contribute the result to things
like <a href="http://code.google.com/p/nltk">NLTK</a> so that other
people don't have to do the same.  I also like using style checkers
and the like to keep myself organized.  (Though I say this, you can
get a more honest picture of my coding style by looking at what I've
actually written.)</p>

<p class="answer">Students who want to work with me should</p>
<ol>
  <li> have basic knowledge of Python, C++, <b>or</b> Java (e.g. be
  able to write a dynamic program in that language),
  <li> understand probability (Bayes rule, conditional probabilities,
  smoothing),
  <li> compile LaTeX documents using BibTeX, and
  <li> use version control software (e.g. git or svn)
</ol>
<p class="answer">These are the bare <b>minimum</b> requirements.  If
you do not meet these requirements, please take some classes to
acquire these skills (preferably mine!) before asking to collaborate
on research.</p>

<p class="answer">You should already code in <b>some</b> language
pretty well, and conforming to my coding style will increase the
probability that I'll be more hands-on in helping you code and debug,
but if you want to program in LISP or Prolog, that's perfectly fine
too, as long as it works for you.</p>

<p class="answer">Being comfortable with probability is probably the
more important requirement.  You'll likely have to deal with messy
probability distributions, take expectations, derive conditional
distributions given a joint distribution, implement dynamic programing
to sample from PCFG grammars, do Taylor approximations, do some
optimizations, etc.  This shouldn't be taken as a laundry list of
things you should know (it's great if you do) but just as a heads up
of the kinds of things you might run into; part of a graduate
education (life, for that matter) is learning new stuff.  There will
be many opportunities to learn: from classes, your peers, and reading
group.</p>

<p class="answer">I think attending (and contributing to) a reading
group or two is critical for learning about a field and being a good
scholar; it's fun and not a chore at all, but I want to be up front in
saying that any student of mine should be an <b>active</b> participant
(i.e., don't just show up; you need to present paper and be involved
in the discussion of every paper.  If you didn't understand a paper,
ask smart questions until you do.  If you did understand a paper well,
answer other people's questions.) in a reading group or two.</p>

<p class="answer">Reading groups are also important for being able to
"look smart" when you're interviewing.  You'll need to be able to
connect your work to what other people do.  A reading group lets you
know how your thesis connects to other research topics and talk
intelligently about them.  Unfortunately, this can't be done quickly;
it requires dedication over many years to learn about the breadth of
research that folks explore.  So while you might feel like skipping
reading group once is a good decision to get more work done, it's
ultimately a bad decision because you need to consistently go to
understand a broad range of topics.</p>

<p class="question">How do you interact with students?</p>

<p class="answer">I like to have a group meeting every other week with
students I'm working with (broadly construed), and one-on-one meetings
as needed with students.  I use Google calendar
to <a href="http://jbg.youcanbook.me">set up my appointments</a>, so
students can grab a meeting whenever they need to.  I expect students
working with me full time to meet with me on average once a week
(sometimes much more, such as before a paper deadline, and sometimes
less).  I use this online system so that my meetings are contiguous
and that students always know when I'm available (and I can change
things without e-mail).  Students should sign up for a meeting at
least 24 hours in advance.  It's okay to schedule meetings outside of
that time, but that should be the exception (I try to maximize the
amount of contiguous time I have to research, write, and think).</p>

<p class="answer">In addition, everyone in my group (me included)
sends a weekly e-mail to everybody saying:
<ul>
  <li class="answer"> What they worked on that week </li>
  <li class="answer"> What they plan to work on next week </li>
  <li class="answer"> Anything that's holding them up or blocking their progress </li>
</ul></p>
<p class="answer">Anyone who is working for me full time or who is my
direct advisee <b>must</b> send me such an e-mail (with the subject
[Snippet YYYY MM DD]) sometime Sunday evening or Monday morning.  I
find that this is very helpful because I sometimes ask myself (or have
funding agencies ask me) what I (and my students) did in a particular
time period.  These e-mails really help me figure that out without
bugging other people.  It also helps me stay productive by setting
realistic goals; I use this weekly todo list to populate my daily todo
list.</p>

<p class="answer">So what makes a good goal?  You should have "Big
Picture Goals" that carry over from week to week; these are often at
the level of something you want to make happen this year or semester.
Every week you should do something that brings you closer to achieving
those big goals.  Within a week, your goals should
be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">smart</a>.
Don't have vague goals like "write code" or "continue reading".  It
should be obvious whether you suceeded or not in your goal (specific
and measureable), it should fit in with the big picture (relevant), it
should be doable in a week (time-bound and attainable).</p>

<p class="answer">It's okay to send it earlier than Monday; the
weekend is fine too.  If you're a day late, that's less good, but
better than not sending it at all.  However, keep the Monday date in
the subject so I can search for it.  (Or just reply to the first
Snippet that gets sent; no need to wait for me, it's okay to start the
chain.) </p>

<p class="answer">The snippet should be sent to both the project
you're working on the group e-mail list. </p>

<p class="answer">Outside of that, I prefer face-to-face communication
(when I'm not sitting down at my computer being productive) or e-mail
as a communication mechanism.  Instant messages are also sometimes
okay for quick questions, but never send an e-mail and then ask via IM
"Did you see my e-mail?"</p>

<p class="question">Do I have to be in lab?</p>

<p class="answer">One of the great things about academia is the
ability to have a flexible schedule, working when and where you want.
However, there are limits to this.  On days where we have meetings,
it's best if you come <b>in person</b> to those meetings.  Within
reason, it's okay to join remotely some of the time, but the norm
should be to attend in person.</p>

<p class="answer">Beyond meetings, it's also good to work a <b>full
day</b> at least once a week.  It's important to have a place where
you can work productively in the lab, be a part of the lab community,
and to absorb the lab culture and its tacit knowledge.  Don't just
appear on campus for meetings and then disappear.</p>

<p class="answer">Finally, when we have a big paper deadline, you
absolutely <b>must make every effort</b> to be in lab (if you aren't
lab, I expect a far better explanation than "I didn't feel like it").
I work very hard to make sure I'm able to do this (e.g., flying in
relatives to help with my daughter), and I expect you to do the same.
The most important part of your job is publishing papers, and while
there are good electronic tools to facilitate collaboration, they are
not a replacement for in-person communication.  Particularly for
inexperienced students, being around older students working on papers
is a very valuable experience.  You don't know what you don't know,
and you can get valuable information from being in the same room as
other people working on papers.</p>

<p class="question">I need you to do something (look over a draft,
send an e-mail, etc.).  How should I best make sure that happens?</p>

<p class="answer">The most important thing is to make sure it's on my
radar.  If you have an important deadline, make sure it appears in
your snippet that you send me weekly.  I will make sure I budget my
time to ensure that it gets taken care of.  Give me as much warning as
possible.  I get grumpy if I have to rearrange my schedule for you at
the last minute.</p>

<p class="answer">It's fine (and helpful) for you to remind me.
However, I'd like to make the following caveats.  Unless the deadline
is hours away, the best way is over e-mail; not phone or IM.  It's
less intrusive and I have systems for dealing with tasks that arrive
over e-mail.  The frequency of the reminder is also important.  No
more than once every five days, I would suggest.</p>

<p class="answer">Finally, make it as easy as possible for me to do
what you need me to do.  Have your reminder e-mail reference all of
the material I need to do the task.  If I'm reviewing a paper, remind
me where in the repository it lives and send me a compiled PDF.  If I
need to write a letter, provide the background material and the
contact information in one place.</p>

<p class="question">How important are classes once I'm a PhD student?</p>

<p class="answer">One very frequent problem I see is that young first
year PhD students want to do very well in their classes and think of
research as a hobby.</p>

<p class="answer">For RAs, it is very much a job.  Your professor has
secured funding for PhD students to do research and to produce
results.  If you fail to produce, it makes the professor look bad to
his funders, and the professor will not want to pay you to do research
in the future (i.e., like a job, you can get fired).</p>

<p class="answer">Grades are not important whatsoever, so long as
you're not getting kicked out of the program.  You should use classes
to become a better researcher, but if you're chasing after an A when a
B would suffice and your research suffers, that's detrimental to
yourself, your professor, and to science.<p>

<p class="answer">If you're not an RA (on fellowship or TA), then
doing research is often a tryout for an RA.  Unless you're 100% sure
you'll have fellowship funding your entire time as a PhD student, you
should make sure your professor would take you on as an RA in a
heartbeat if needed.</p>

<p class="question">How often should I be publishing?</p>

<p class="answer">You should always have an idea that you're actively
working on for a paper.  Publishing between 1-2 papers a year is a
good average (however, this does not mean that you'll always have a
publication every year).  Under normal circumstances, I expect
students have one publication at least submitted before the end of
their second year, two by their proposal, and three by their defense
(it's of course fine to have more, but don't prioritize quantity over
quality).</p>

<p class="answer">If you haven't published in two consecutive years as
a first author in a top venue, that's a huge problem, and you're
unlikely to get an RA in the future.</p>

<p class="question">I'm submitting a paper we talked about, can I add
you as an author?</p>

<p class="answer">I should not be surprised by a paper.  If I'm going
to be an author, I want to: 1) see a draft with the "big picture" at
least two weeks before the deadline 2) see a nearly complete draft at
least a week before the deadline. (I reserve the right to still say no
to papers even if you follow these rules, e.g., if I'm on
vacation.)</p>

<p class="answer">For students working directly with me in my group,
this is less of an issue, I know what's going on and can judge what's
going on and whether we can submit (a collaborative discussion).  But
for students who come to me to discuss an idea, dissapear for two
months, and then suddenly appear and want me to be a coauthor, this
can be pretty annoying.  My likely response is "no", I will not be a
coauthor, and I will not contribute to the paper.  If you wait until
the last minute, the paper likely won't be any good, and I have other
papers with authors who were responsible and played by the rules.</p>

<p class="answer">You can still choose to submit, but <b>do not list
me as an author</b>.</p>

<p class="question">Can I work on projects that don't involve you?</p>

<p class="answer">First, there's a question of funding.  If you're
funded on a fellowship, TA, or self-funded, then you just need to make
sure that I'm happy to continue advising you (i.e., making good
progress to your degree).  It's fine to take a break and explore your
interests, but don't ignore your thesis.</p>

<p class="answer">However, If you're funded on a grant, you need to be
working on work that's consistent with the goals of the grant.
Maintaining these relationships is necessary for me (and future
students) to have funding.</p>

<p class="answer">This isn't to say that you can never work on a
project that doesn't involve me.  For example, many students need a
week or two to wrap up their internship projects.  This is totally
fine, and it's not reasonable (or appropriate) for me to get involved.
However, if you're still working with your internship advisors six
months afterward and it's interfering with your grant-funded work,
then I either need to be invovled or you need to give it up.  At the very
least there needs to be a frank conversation between me and the
internship host (it's not fair for you to have to manage these
conflicting relationships/priorities).</p>

<h3>Academia and Research</h3>

<p class="question">Is topic modeling dead?  Should we all be doing
deep learning?</p>

<p class="answer">Deep learning should be part of any modern
researcher's toolkit.  However, I do not think that this means that we
should completely abandon topic models.  Topic models are still very
useful for use cases where <i>interpretability</i> is important.
You'll still see many researchers
in <a href="http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/topic-modeling-and-digital-humanities-by-david-m-blei/">digital
humanities</a> using topic models, for instance, because they care
about telling a good story and understanding their data.</p>

<p class="answer">As topic models become more of a utility, I think
we'll see less of the "topic model of the week" that we saw 2005-2010.
I think the important questions are how to incorporate topic models
into real-world workflows and measuring whether topic models help
users with those tasks.  At the risk of self-promotion, I think a good
example of that is Forough's paper
on <a href="https://aclanthology.coli.uni-saarland.de/papers/P16-1110/alto-active-learning-with-topic-overviews-for-speeding-label-induction-and-document-labeling">how
topic models help people annotate data more effectively</a>.</p>

<p class="answer">One place where we will see less activity is topic
modeling is as a <b>feature</b> for downstream model, which was quite
popular for a while.  Here, word embeddings have completely taken
over.  They obviously do a better job, but perhaps the
interpretability of topic models was a nice side effect that we're
missing out on.</p>

<p class="answer">For a more complete overview of where I think topic
modeling has been, what's it's been useful for, and where it's going,
Yuening, David and I have a new book
on <a href="http://www.nowpublishers.com/article/Details/INR-030">Applications
of Topic Models</a>.</p>

<p class="question">How should I collect/store data?</p>

<p class="answer">Google <a href="https://matthewlincoln.net/2018/03/26/best-practices-for-using-google-sheets-in-your-data-project.html">spreadsheets
are good</a> in most cases during collection.  But once we're done,
they should be stored in a way that's long-term readable (e.g.,
JSON/CSV) and deposited with a library.</p>

<h3>Other</h3>

<p class="question">You're part of an iSchool?  What's that?</p>

<p class="answer">It's <A
HREF="https://faculty.washington.edu/wobbrock/pubs/interactions-09.pdf">fun</A>.
Unlike computer science, which can sometimes ignore humans, iSchools
care about the intersection of information, technology, and society.
It's a good fit for me because I'm interested in computational social
science and human-in-the-loop machine learning.</P>

<p class="question">I'm trying to use your code, but I'm having
trouble.  How should I get help?</p>

<p class="answer">E-mail all of the people who worked on the paper associated
with the code with
<ol>
   <li> a minimal (simple as possible) example that can replicate your problem;
   <li> the inputs that replicate your problem (again, this should be as simple
   as possible; sending multi-megabyte files is usually not minimal);
   <li> exactly what you did (the exact command line used);
   <li> what you expected to see;
   <li> what you got instead (include error messages and any output); and
   <li> what versions of various resources you're using (NLTK, Java, gcc, boost,
   protocol buffers, etc.).
</ol></p>

<p class="answer">This information is necessary for us to help you with your
problem.  The simpler it is to replicate your problem, the faster you will get a
response.  More complicated setup take longer for us to try out and debug.  If
your example is simple enough, we can often see the problem ourselves without

<p class="answer">Each e-mail should be self-contained.  All the information to
reproduce the bug should be in one place. This helps us quickly reproduce the
bug, and it also ensures that you've not tweaked anything that might prevent us
from isolating the issue.</p>

<p class="question">What are your pronoun preferences?</p>

<p class="answer">For myself, he/him/his and they/them/their are both fine.  I
prefer the latter for academic writing and the former for day-to-day
communication.</p>

<p class="answer">If I use the wrong pronoun for you, please let me
know ASAP.</p>

<p class="question">What's up with your name?  Why is it hyphenated?
  What should I call you?  Why is your UMD username "ying"?</p>

<p class="answer">My parents' last names are Boyd and Graber.  When I
was born they hyphenated (why people whose nicknames were "Toni the
Body" and "Little Grabber" would do so is beyond me; my nickname is
obvious).  As a result, I am deeply, personally, against hyphenating
names.  Don't do it.  It's not a sustainable practice, and it leads to
all sorts of problems.  People think my last name is just "Boyd" or
"Graber", web forms don't think I have a valid name, and there's only
about a forty percent chance someone will get my name right after one
telling.</p>

<p class="answer">Most people call me Jordan, which is just fine by me.  I
also answer to JBG.</p>

<p class="answer">Our family calls itself the "Ying"s (wife's name).
That's why my UMD username is ying (and why "Ying" is listed on
Testudo).  My wife, who got to UMD after me,
is <a href="https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~zying/">zying</a>.</p>

<p class="question">I'm a TA or grader for one of your courses; what do I need to know?</p>

<ol>
  <li> First, make sure that we have a meeting before the semester starts.
  <li> Attend at least a class or two to get a feel of what's going on.
  <li> As each assignment is posted, look it over to make sure I haven't done
  anything stupid (e.g., a confusing problem); it will make your life easier.
  <li> Once assignments arrive, create an ontology of all of the mistakes that
  people have made (do this before you start "grading"); this will allow you to
  fairly and consistently deduct points.
  <li> Using that ontology, create a template that you can use to provide
  feedback to students (e.g. by copy/paste or deleting).  This allows you to
  explain each mistake in detail without having to retype the same thing over
  and over again.  It also ensures that you give consistent feedback for each
  mistake people make.
  <li> Post a synopsis of the mistakes that people made and how to correct them.
  <li> Never give a grade without explaining why people got the grade they did.
</ol>

<p class="question">Why did you leave the University of Maryland and
then why did you go back?</p>

<p class="answer"> I came to Colorado (where I was born) to be close
to my family (especially my dad, who had some health scares) and to
start of a family of our own. All of this went according to
plan. However, after getting laid off during her pregnancy, for two
years my wife was unable to find a science communications position in
Colorado.  (I also had professional issues of my own, but these issues
were less acute than my wife's career.)</p>

<p class="answer"> In late 2016, my wife got a great job offer from
UMD and six months later I was very happy to be able to follow her
(there were some stressful months in between, though!). I was very
excited to be returning to the great research environment across
computer science (tenure home), UMIACS, language science, and the
iSchool (each chipped in for my position). </p>

<p class="answer"> But there’s a lot I will miss about Colorado
(where I was born and paradise on Earth!), and I
am hoping for lots of opportunities to spend time there and maintain
the fabulous professional connections I’ve made there.  It's too bad
Colorado was a poor place for us to advance our careers.</p>

<p class="question">What's your Erd&#246;s-Bacon number?</p>

<p class="answer">While at Princeton, I was also involved with the aphasia
project with Maria Klawe (as a result, I have
an <a href="http://www.oakland.edu/enp/">Erd&#246;s number</a>
of <a href="https://files.oakland.edu/users/grossman/enp/Erdos2.html">2</a>). My
Bacon number is as yet undefined (call me).  </p>

<!-- My Bacon number is 3 if TV appearances are permissible links: I
appared on Jeopardy! with Alex Trebek, who had a cameo in Short Cuts
(1993) with Fred Ward, who was in Tremors (1990) with Kevin Bacon.
Thus, my Erd&#246;s-Bacon number is 5, higher than Feynman and Carl
Sagan, tied with Bernard Chazelle, and lower than Natalie Portman and
Noam Chomsky.  -->
