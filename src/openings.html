<h2>Positions Available in my Group</h2>

<p>You may also want to look at "Propsective Students" on
my <A HREF="faq.html">FAQ</a> page, which covers how to apply and what
sorts of students I'm interested in.</p>

<h3>Postdocs</h3>

<p>No current openings.</p>

<h3>Graduate Students</h3>

I'm looking for one or two PhD students interested in question
  answering, adversarial examples, or demographic fairness in ML.  If
  you have an extra-curricular background running trivia tournaments
  (pub quiz, quiz bowl, etc.), please mention that, as it's relevant
  to some funding I'm going after right now.

<h3>(Non-UMD) Undergraduates</h3>

<p>I'm interested in hosting undergraduates from leading institutions,
but only if an introduction is made through <b>a faculty member that I
know</b> and who can vouch for the student.  I'm also only able to
  fund US citizens.</p>

<p>If you cannot make a connection through a faculty member I know,
  then I'm very sorry but I cannot host you.  There's simply no way
  for me to vet all of the requests for internships that I get.</p>

<h3>High School Students</h3>

<p>I'm only interested in working with high school students in the DC
area.  They must: already know how to program in Python, have an
existing, demonstrated interest in the areas that I work in, and be
extremely motivated.  I limit myself to the DC area because there is
an advantage to being able to meet in person; particularly for high
school students, it's difficult to read nuance over the web.
Moreover, it's possible for me to be familiar with local schools and
their programs.  There are simply too many high school students the
world over for me to work with closely.</p>

<p>Once a student contacts me, I will assign a relatively trivial
programming task to them that requires them to understand and modify
an existing piece of code.  This is a necessary prerequisite to
working with me and has a one-week time limit.  (Thus, do not contact
me if you are not going to have any free time over the next few
weeks.)</p>

<p>I know this seems like a lot of hassle, but I want to make sure
that the students I work with are ready to get to work immediately.
Funding is possible, but only after a one-month trial period.</p>
