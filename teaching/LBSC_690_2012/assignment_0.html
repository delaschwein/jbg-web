<h1>LBSC 690: Introduction to Information Technology</h1>

<h2>Assignment 0</h2>

<p>This assignment is not worth points.  It just lays the groundwork for later
assignments.  It is however, critically important that you complete this
assignment; otherwise, you'll have problems later.</p>

<OL>
  <LI>Subscribe and create an account on Piazza.  Write a post introducing yourself.  I'd also suggest adding a picture of yourself to the account, as it helps everybody get to know each other.
  <LI>Download and install the following programs to your computer:
    <OL>
      <LI> <a href="http://winscp.net/eng/index.php">WinSCP</a> or <a href="http://fetchsoftworks.com/">Fetch</a>
      <LI> <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome">Chrome</a>
      <LI> (Windows only, not needed on OS X or Linux) <a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html">Putty</a>
    </OL>
  <LI>Use Putty or Terminal to connect to terpconnect
    <UL>
      <LI> In Putty, create a new session connecting to the host "terpconnect.umd.edu" using the "SSH" protocol.  When prompted, enter your Terpconnect password.
      <LI> In Terminal, start an ssh session by typing "ssh USERNAME@terpconnect.umd.edu".  When prompted, enter your Terpconnect password.
      <LI> Once connected, enter the commands as shown below.
    </UL>
  <LI>Type the following:
    <PRE>
      ln -s ../pub public_html
      wget <a href="http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~ying/LBSC_690/books.db">http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~ying/LBSC_690/books.db</a>
</a>
      ls -l public_html books.db > public_html/I_DID_IT.txt
    </PRE>
    This will create a new folder for your webpages, download a databse we'll
    use for a later assignment, and create a file that will verify that you did
    everything.
</OL>

<p> To submit your assignment, send an e-mail
to <a href="mailto:jbg@umiacs.umd.edu">jbg@umiacs.umd.edu</a> with the subject
starting with <b>[LBSC690 Assignment0]</b>.  In the e-mail, just send a quick
e-mail saying that you sucessfully did each of the above steps and a link to
your file:
<PRE>
http://terpconnect.umd.edu/~YOURUSERNAME/I_DID_IT.txt
</PRE>
</p>

<p> This is not graded, and you can and should get as much help as you need.
The goal is to make sure any technical kinks get worked out before, say, you
have an assignment due.  So ask plenty of questions on Piazza, come to office
hours, whatever!</p>
