  <h2>Assignment 4: Project Proposal</h2>


  <p><b>Due:</b> Monday 4/11 (11:59pm)</p>


<p>In this assignment, you will tell us what you want to do for your final project.  A few guidelines:</p>



<ul>
  <li>The project can focus on any topic you want, as long as it is related to
  themes of this course (MapReduce, large-data, cloud computing, etc.).  The
  project must either involve the Google/IBM cluster or equivalent (AWS, Azure,
  or Bespin).  We will discuss some project ideas in class. </li>

  <li>You can work in groups of up to three, but you can also work by
  yourself if you wish.  We would encourage a group final
  project.</li>

  <li>The amount of effort devoted to this project should be proportional to the
  number of people in the team.  We would expect a level of effort comparable to
  two assignments <i>per person</i> (since you have approximately a month to
  complete the project).</li>

  <li>Start early on the project.  Remember, there's also a final exam
  for the course and there is typically a lot going on at the end of
  the semester.  Poor time management is not an excuse for a low
  quality project.</li>

  <li>Have incremental milestones that you can reach and present.  A
  good project will have a very easy first step and get progressively
  harder as more stuff is added.  That way, if you run out of time,
  you'll still have something concrete.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Submission Instructions</h3>

<p>This assignment is due by 11:59pm, Monday 4/11.  Please send us (Jordan and
Yingying) an email with "[CCC Assignment 4]" as the subject.
We only need one email per group.  In the body of the email, provide the
following information:</p>

<ul>

  <li>The group members.</li>

  <li>Description of your project.  We are expecting 1-2 pages (attachment is
  okay, but please send PDF) that describe the idea.  Include: the data you wish
  to work on, the approach, and the expected results (something concrete that
  can be evaluated).</li>

  <li>A timeline of the project.</li>

</ul>
