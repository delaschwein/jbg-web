<h1>LBSC 690: Introduction to Information Technology</h1>

<h2>Extra Credit Assignment</h2>

<p>This assignment is worth 20 points.  If you choose to do it, it is due before
class on November 26.

<h2>LBSC 690: Extra Credit Assignment (Fall 2012)</h2>

<p>The goal of this program is to type in a LOC subject code and for the program
to return the name of subject associated with the code.  For example, if you enter "F0178", the program should tell you "Atlantic coast.  Middle Atlantic States: Maryland".</p>

<p>In the <a href="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/teaching/LBSC_690_2012/javascript_demo/loc.html">source file</a>, there are three arrays, one with the start
of the category (start), one with the end of the category (end), and one with
the name of the category (name).  The indices of the arrays are consistent.  For
example, </p>

<p>What you need to do is to complete the "Lookup" function so that it returns
the category name.</p>

<p>The most efficient way to do this is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>.  Start at the middle of all the arrays, and see whether the range you want is before or after your current position.  Then do the same thing on either the first half or the second half of the list.</p>

<p>Note that there can be multiple categories that match - you can earn extra
points for finding all valid categories (points for doing it as efficiently as
possible).</p>

<HR/>

You grade will depend on how efficient your implementation is.  If you need to
go through all the entries every time, you won't get many points (but you'll get
some).  If you need to go through on average half the entries, you'll get more
points.  A perfect solution should take on average no more than 12 lookups to
find the appropriate range.

Also note that there are ways to improve your score: find all appropriate
categories given a query, automatically reformat queries, detect ill-formed
queries, or allow a user to gracefully exit.
