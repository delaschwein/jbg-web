\maketitle

When the pandemic started, I was on sabbatical.  So I didn’t need to
dramatically change the way I taught overnight, thank heavens.
%
Moroever, unlike many of my peers, I
already had a large library of recorded lectures because I’ve been
doing a flipped classroom for a decade.  Here’s my very first lecture
from 2013.
%
Nevertheless, I still had to change the way I taught.
%
Let me tell you why and how it changed how I taught.

\section{Flipped Classroom}

If you haven’t heard the term before, a flipped classroom is where you
record the lectures, students watch them before class, and then you
use the normal class time to answer questions, work through exercises,
or to talk about tricky issues on homeworks.
%
Following the
suggestions of \newcite{Zappe}{09}, I keep my videos short (around 30
minutes total, edited for concision and broken into 5-15 minute
chunks).

For example, when I talk about topic models, I have a video where I
explain the basics by myself.
%
Then I bring in an external expert to
go over some of the details, and then I show a video from a conference
presentation on a topic.
%
The technical quality of the videos have
improved considerably over the years: I’ve moved from just a screen
capture to a multiple camera setup with green screen.

Then in class, I answer any questions students have and then we go
through an exercise.
%
For instance, we walk through Gibbs sampling
works for a toy example.
%
Students calculate—by hand—the sampling
equation and go through the process to get the answer.

% A lot of teachers do not like the flipped classroom, and I can
% understand why.
%
% First, it’s a lot of work, and it requires planning.
% When I co-taught a flipped classroom with an uninitiated professor, he
% ended up cursing my name for convincing him to take part.

\subsection{Building Bonds}

There’s research to suggest that the flipped classroom can help
students engage and retain information~\cite{Zuber-16}, but that’s not
the real reason that I do it.
%
I do it because it helps me get to know the students better.  Computer
science is the biggest major at Maryland (over three thousand), and
AI-adjacent fields are even more popular within that major, so my
classes are getting pretty darn big.
%
If I didn’t do a flipped
classroom, I would know so many fewer students.

And the flipped classroom also helps form bonds between students.
%
When I was an undergrad, I wanted to take organic chemistry even
though I was a history / \abr{cs} major.
%
That failed because studying for
that class was pretty social, and I was not a chemistry major, so I
didn’t have an existing support network coming in.
%
Now that I’m a
professor, one of the reasons I like the flipped classroom is that it
forces people to talk to each other to figure out what questions they
want to ask, work together to solve practice problems, etc.
%
Those
groups and those connections often carry over to homework groups and
project groups.

And this helps me serve the few iSchool, Linguistics, and other ``odd
ball'' students who, like Jordan in 2003 are trying to explore
something new to them and don’t have an established buddy group (which
many of the CS students have).  The flipped classroom helps them get
to know the people who can help them survive and thrive in the course.

When I once I fell off the wagon and went back to a ``normal'' lecture
mode because it was my first time teaching the class, it had a hundred
people, and I had no TA.  I was told that students coming in would
know python.  But it turns out that a big contingent had only played
around with the language for a week or two and were pretty unprepared!
And because I didn’t flip the classroom, I found out too late that
many students were really struggling with Python.  This wouldn’t have
happened in a flipped classroom where I could see that the struggle
was real in front of my own eyes.

So back to March 2020. To make sure that I did not miss out on
creating educational content, I started creating a weekly pub quiz to
replace quiz cancelled by our usual haunt.  And as the pandemic
dragged on and on, I learned how to create interactive, fun
environments that got small groups to discuss problems, come to a
solution, and then share it with the group.  And I learned how to
broadcast with a greenscreen in real-time and share multimedia with
the group.  (All outlined in this document that formed the foundation
for many pandemic-era pub quizzes.)  I used the same format and
technology for Google’s Efficient QA competition that I hosted.

\section{Hybrid Classrooms}

Given all of this, I thought that when we (mostly) returned into
hybrid classrooms, I’d be all set for the new world of teaching.
After all, I had already mastered asynchronous videos, and I had
practiced online-only interactions thanks to our quizzes.  I was not
ready, however.  In a real classroom, I could tell when a student was lost or
disengaged.  This is not true when many students are on Zoom.  A
hybrid classroom has a particularly pernicious failure mode: a student
doesn’t watch the videos, gets lost in the discussion, and then
silently disengages.

To make matters worse, many of the improved learning outcomes in
flipped classrooms come from regular quizzes~\cite{tune-13}, which if
nothing else would have diagnosed students disengaging. In an attempt
to make classroom management easier and to lighten the burden on
students, I suspended quizzes.  Another mistake!

And this isn’t transitory.  I think the hybrid classroom is going to
be with us for a while.  Even after we returned to classrooms,
students were struggling with visa issues, health issues beyond Covid,
were attending conferences, were at home for a wedding, or were snowed
in.  It makes the classroom more equitable and flexible.

And like many faculty, I’m still developing best practice on how to do
this.  I encourage people to keep their cameras on and I make a big
deal of the 10\% participation grade.  This creates some
annoyances\dots for example, students asking questions for the sake of
hitting the participation quota rather than actually wanting
information, but it’s a small price to pay.  I’m proud that after a
shaky start and uncooperative \abr{av}, I’m getting good engagement
from both in-person and Zoom students.

\section{Assignments}

But teaching is not just about lectures.  My courses typically have a
few small, practical assignments (typically three to five), a midterm,
and a course project.

The assignments give continuity to the class and allow students to
practice skills introduced in the class; I encourage students to work
together to solve homework problems.
%
For example, students put together a logistic regression classifier to determine if an answer to a question is correct or not.  In my mind, an ideal homework assignment has an easy to achieve initial goal but leaves room for exploration.  Returning to the logistic regression example, just implementing stochastic gradient descent challenges some students (and they stop there), but for students who want to explore further, they can try out different step sizes and updating schedules for extra credit.

The midterm serves as a reality check for both my students and me.  I design exams with five to six free response questions (of which students must answer a subset) that synthesize disparate concepts from the course in a problem context (e.g., for a machine learning course, proving the \abr{vc} complexity of a simple hypothesis class).  Based on the results of the midterm, I can identify students that might need extra help or what areas I need to cover in more detail.

But because I work on applying social science methods—like item response theory—-to machine learning datasets to identify easy, difficult, or ambiguous examples, it’s only right that I take my own medicine to examine multiple choice questions and use these methods to figure out how good my exam questions are.

\section{Projects}

Because I want to make sure that my students can actually use their skills once they’re done with the class, I typically end courses with a project.  It reinforces key concepts from the
course, connects those concepts to the rest of their curriculum and research, and often serves as a launching point to things that are useful in the real world.  For undergraduate classes, this is more directed: in one class they build trivia-playing robots to take on former Jeopardy! Champions or a chaser from the American version of The Chase.  For graduate courses, projects are more open-ended.  Projects in my courses have become a comedy troupe's website, have unearthed previously unknown primary sources on local history, helped students advance in the workplace, and resulted in academic publications.  As a testament to the effectiveness of these relationships, after one graduate course I taught (Computational Linguistics II, UMD CMSC 773), I ended up publishing papers with four of the eight students.

The projects help individuals calibrate the course to their own needs and abilities; because the project is directed toward things they care about, the teams working on the projects typically stretch their abilities more than I could through predefined assignments.  

\section{Outreach}

And I like to think that my teaching style has helped learners outside
the University of Maryland make progress toward learning about the
interaction between science and society.  The videos on my YouTube
channel have been viewed a million times and my most popular videos
about fifty thousand times.  This has offered me new connections:
e.g., people who come up to me at conferences to say that they learned
variational inference or TV producers wanting to make a Human
vs. Computer game show.

A major part of my research is making machine learning accessible to
high school students.
%
My human-computer question answering exhibition
matches have attracted thousands of interested high school students in
\abr{dc}, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta, and Seattle.
%
I've also served as a mentor as a part of Maryland's Bitcamp and
Technica hackathon programs on projects of women and underrepresented
minorities to build \abr{qa} systems.

\image{atlanta_hsnct}{}

Thus, I’m glad that I had to up my game because of the pandemic, starting with an ad hoc trivia game in mid March 2020.  I think it’s a good example of how with technology we can better serve those who want to learn, whether they’re our students or not.  And while some innovations are a matter of necessity rather than of careful deliberation and insight, we should still embrace them if they help students learn better.

\subsection{Mentoring Undergraduates}

Like everything else, the pandemic has changed the way I work with
undergraduate researchers.
%
I began a ``anyone welcome'' summer virtual internship for
undergraduate students to work on small, bite-sized projects that fit
into a larger research program (usually directed by a mid-career grad
student).
%
Our work with undergraduates has been published in top
venues like \abr{naacl} and \abr{chi}, and the undergraduates I've worked with
have gone on to have successful research careers (e.g., Lester Mackey became
faculty at Stanford before moving to Microsoft Research, Eric Wallace is now a
PhD student at Berkeley).
%
My current star undergraduate student, Chenglei Si, a junior, already
has four publications in top venues.

\subsection{Mentoring Graduate Students}

I've graduated seventeen PhD students and am the chair or co-chair for
eight current students.  I like to have a group meeting every other
week with students I'm working with (broadly construed), and
one-on-one meetings as needed with students, typically once a week. In
addition, everyone in my group (me included) sends a weekly e-mail to
the group saying: what they worked on that week; what they plan to work
on next week; anything that's holding them up or blocking their
progress. I use an Internet chat program (Slack) to communicate with remote
students and for lower-latency conversations than e-mail.

In their first year, students typically work on a starter project that
builds on a senior student's work, this often becomes a paper with the
new student as a first author.  From there, I work with the student to
craft a trajectory of papers that will form a foundation for the rest
of their graduate studies.  While I'm fairly hands-on with conference
and journal submissions, I never edit proposals or dissertations; I
provide verbal feedback and suggestions but students must find their
own voice in the writing process.

After graduation, my students have gone on to good positions in
industry (e.g., Forough Poursabzi and Ahmed Elgohary at Microsoft
Research; Pedro Rodriguez at \abr{fair}) and academia (e.g., Alvin
Grissom II, Assistant Professor at Haverford; He He, Assistant
Professor at NYU; Mohit Iyyer, Assistant Professor at UMass Amherst).

\section{Example Sylabuses}

Part of my committment to public education is to ensure that all of my course
materials (lectures, syllabus, assignments) are publicly accessible. The most
recent version of each of my courses is listed at
\url{http://users.umiacs.umd.edu/~jbg/static/courses.html}.  My lectures, which have approximately half a million views, are available on YouTube at \url{https://www.youtube.com/c/JordanBoydGraber/videos}.

% \section{What Students Say \dots}

% Below are cherry-picked comments from students either sent as an unsolicited
% e-mail (anonymized and presented with permission) or taken from anonymous course
% evaluations.

% \student{ I just started a new job on Monday as a Librarian at [awesome place].
%   I was hired to catalog a special project with the archives and never thought
%   I'd need anything from [introduction to information technology] \dots And then
%   on the first day we started talking about the database of objects.  When we
%   finally got access to the database, I realized it was entirely a SQL database
%   and had to use everything you taught us last semester to help think of how to
%   run the queries and ask the designer what it is capable of.  }


% \student{
% I actually had a job interview for a professional librarian job this week and it
% was about digital libraries.  They asked me questions about what do I know about
% IP validation, HTML, servers, etc.  Thankfully, fresh out of your class, I was
% able to say ``actually, I know a TON about this stuff! There was a question on
% our midterm about IP validations and everything!''

% I wanted to write to let you know that the things I learned in your class this semester are already having a huge impact on my career.
% }

% \student{I showed the \dots app I made for my final project to my boss, and she
%   ran downstairs to [important person]. He came upstairs to see my app and to
%   talk to me about it. Turns out he has a team researching vendors who could
%   provide our library with a mobile presence much like the one I made for my
%   final project in your class. He was excited to see what I'm capable of and
%   will be putting me in touch with the people on the project. This is a big deal
%   for an entry-level librarian like me.}
